* Code linting with ruff and pre-commit hooks.
* GitHub Actions for automated CI (linting + testing).


## 📦 Requirements

* Python >= 3.10
* Poetry
* Docker (for running the Feddit API locally)

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
poetry install
```

## 🧪 Run the Microservice

```bash
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## 📥 Example Usage

1. **Start the Feddit API using Docker**:

```bash
docker compose -f <path-to-docker-compose.yml> up -d
```

Visit: [http://0.0.0.0:8080](http://0.0.0.0:8080)

2. **Start the microservice**:

```bash
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

3. **Send a request**:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/comments/Dummy%20Topic%201?limit=10&start=2021-06-01T00:00:00Z&end=2022-06-01T00:00:00Z&sort_by_polarity_score=desc"
```

You can also paste the URL directly into your browser.
